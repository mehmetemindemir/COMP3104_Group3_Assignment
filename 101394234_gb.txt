George Brown College notes by Mehmet (101394234)

--- Introduction ---
I am currently studying at George Brown College, a leading public post-secondary institution situated in the heart of downtown Toronto. 
Being so close to Canadaâ€™s financial centre and thousands of industry partners gives me access to a thriving community of students, employees, alumni and donors with deep connections to the city and beyond.
For over 50 years George Brown has helped students like me reach our career and personal goals through innovative programming, applied skills development, and knowledgeable faculty. This environment has been instrumental in shaping my academic and professional growth.
