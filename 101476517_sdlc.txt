COMP3104 - Group Assignment 1

--------- Importance of learning DevOps in the SDLC ---------

COMP 3104 introduces students to the principles and practices of DevOps, emphasizing collaboration between development 
and operations to deliver software efficiently and reliably. The course focuses on automation, continuous integration and 
deployment (CI/CD), version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and modern deployment tools.

You can reasonably assume students will cover things like:
- Version control (e.g. Git)
- Collaboration workflows (branching, merges, pull-requests)
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
- Possibly containerization / Docker / maybe Kubernetes or other orchestration tools
- Some infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible or similar)
- Automated testing and monitoring
- Build automation tools
- Deployment strategies and best practices
