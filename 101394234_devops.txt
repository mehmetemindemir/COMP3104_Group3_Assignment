My view of DevOps: 
In this course, students will explore the principles, practices, and collaborative mindset that DevOps professionals use to bridge the gap between development and operations. 
They will evaluate modern automation, monitoring, and deployment techniques, and apply hands-on exercises with industry-standard tools to streamline software delivery. 
By following DevOps best practices, students will learn to design and implement reliable, scalable solutions that accelerate delivery cycles and improve business outcomes.
