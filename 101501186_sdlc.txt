--------- Importance of learning DevOps in the SDLC ---------

Learning DevOps is essential in the software development life cycle because it bridges 
the gap between development and operations. It ensures faster delivery, continuous testing, 
and better product quality through automation and collaboration. DevOps practices help
teams detect issues early, reduce deployment failures, and maintain consistent software 
performance.
